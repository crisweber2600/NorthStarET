# Specification Quality Checklist: Aspire Orchestration & Cross-Cutting Scaffolding

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-20
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) *Note: Feature is infrastructure scaffolding, so technology names are required domain terms.*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders *Note: Stakeholders are technical (developers/architects).*
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) *Note: See above.*
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification *Note: See above.*

## Notes

- Spec updated from existing scenario file `00-aspire-scaffolding.md`.
- Layer: CrossCuttingConcerns verified.
