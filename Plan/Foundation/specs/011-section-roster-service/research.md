Research Notes (Section & Roster)

Waitlist Strategy: FIFO with promotion on drop; alternative priority-based deferred.
Rollover Template Generation: Use previous year section frequency & enrollment to decide template creation; consider machine learning later.
Conflict Detection: In-memory schedule map keyed teacherId+period; avoids heavy DB joins.
Export Format: Start with Excel (EPPlus) then PDF (wkhtmltopdf or service) later.
