# Figma Prompt: Maintain District Schools

Design the "Schools & Grades" landing list for district administrators. Show search, sort, create, edit, and delete affordances consistent with the NorthStarET design system. Include success and error toast placements and a delete confirmation modal.

## Implementation Notes (2025-11-12)

- Backend API, BDD steps, and unit tests now exercise school list, create, update, and delete flows.
- UI remains blocked pending frame delivery; keep modal interactions, toast placements, and filter controls aligned with spec once assets arrive.
- Playwright journey stays skipped (`Assert.Ignore("Skipped - No Figma")`) until we receive the finalized design tokens and layout.
