Production code follows Clean Architecture layers: `src/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.UI.*` (presentation), `src/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.Application` (application services), `src/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.Domain` (domain model), and `src/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.Infrastructure` (persistence + integrations). Aspire hosting and service defaults reside in `src/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.AppHost` and `src/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.ServiceDefaults`. Tests mirror the layers: `tests/unit` (xUnit), `tests/integration` (Aspire test projects), `tests/bdd` (Reqnroll), `tests/ui` (Playwright), and `tests/aspire` for orchestration smoke tests. Feature collateral lives under `specs/<feature-id>/`.\n\n## Architecture & Workflow Mandates\n- Enforce Clean Architecture boundaries: UI depends on Application only; Application uses Domain; Infrastructure stays behind interfaces.\n- Orchestrate every service through .NET Aspire hosting/client packages with Service Defaults applied.\n- Integration tests must be Aspire projects validating hosting, configuration, and cross-service flows.\n- Prefer asynchronous eventing; any necessary synchronous call documents latency budgets and fallbacks inside specs and PRs.\n- User journeys require Figma-backed Given/When/Then scenarios and Playwright validation; missing Figma links label the task “Skipped — No Figma” and pause implementation until designs and supporting `figma-prompts/` collateral exist.\n- Label every UI task as `UI` in plans/tasks and attach its Figma frame before work begins.\n- After each phase (plan, implement, verify) run `dotnet build` and the full automated suite; main branch is the single source of truth with CI enforcing gates.\n- Finish every task by commit → pull → push so shared history stays linear.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\n- `dotnet restore` — install all solution dependencies (run once per environment).\n- `dotnet build NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.sln` — compile every project with Aspire defaults applied.\n- `dotnet test tests/unit/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.Application.Tests.csproj` (and other test projects) — execute layer-specific suites during Red → Green.\n- `dotnet test --collect:\"XPlat Code Coverage\"` — verify ≥80 % coverage before merging.\n- `pwsh tests/ui/playwright.ps1` — run Playwright journeys that validate Figma-backed flows end to end.\n- `dotnet test tests/aspire/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.AspireTests.csproj` — ensure hosting and client packages stay wired correctly.\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\nWrite C# 12 with four-space indentation and align namespaces with folder paths. Use PascalCase for classes, interfaces (`IInterface`), and public members; camelCase for locals and parameters. Keep UI projects Razor-first; application/domain projects stay class library only. Run `dotnet format` before opening a PR. Aspire assets must apply `ServiceDefaults` in `Program.cs`. Configuration files under `env/` never store secrets—rely on the platform secret store.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\nAdhere to TDD: create failing unit, integration, BDD, and Playwright tests before implementation. Reqnroll feature files sit in `specs/<feature-id>/features/`; commit step definition stubs (in `tests/bdd/...Steps.cs`) before writing production logic. Aspire integration and Playwright suites must run at each delivery checkpoint. Name test classes `<TypeUnderTest>Tests` and methods `Should_<behavior>`. Maintain ≥80 % line coverage and capture evidence in CI runs; CI will block merges on failing gates.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\nCommit after every completed task with imperative messages such as `feat: add district invite flow` or `test: harden aspire orchestration`. Reference linked specs/tasks (`specs/001-feature-title-login/...`) and include Figma URLs for UI changes. Pull requests must show passing CI, attach screenshots or recordings for UI updates, list impacted tests (unit, Reqnroll, Playwright, Aspire), and note any synchronous calls along with latency budgets and fallbacks.\n\n## Security & Configuration Tips\nNever log or commit secrets; load them through the platform secret store and Aspire-managed configuration. UI projects must depend on Application services only—direct Infrastructure references are constitution violations. When introducing synchronous cross-service calls, document latency budgets and fallback paths inside the PR description and related spec.\n","source":"cli","git":{"commit_hash":"c66426f4b3cac08712fc722ada74fe9cb423d3c2","branch":"002-feature-title-login","repository_url":"git@github.com:crisweber2600/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.git"}}}

Re-validated after Phase 1 design._\\n\\n- [x] Clean Architecture layering is fixed (UI → Application → Domain → Infrastructure) and Api/Web will call `AddServiceDefaults` / `MapDefaultEndpoints` under Aspire orchestration.\\n- [x] Aspire integration tests (`tests/aspire/...`) already scaffolded and will be extended to cover Api/Web health plus invite flows.\\n- [x] TDD cadence captured in tasks: unit specs precede implementation, coverage ≥ 80%, and each phase triggers `dotnet build` + full test suites.\\n- [x] UI scope references Figma frames (Section \\\"User Story 1/2\\\"), documents supporting `figma-prompts/` collateral, and maps owning Reqnroll features plus Playwright specs in tasks.md.\\n- [x] Data flow prioritizes async event publication; any synchronous notification fallback documents latency budgets in spec/tasks.\\n- [x] Security posture enforces least privilege through Application services, OIDC claims, and no UI → Infrastructure coupling; secrets remain outside repo.\\n- [x] Delivery workflow honors commit/pull/push cycle with `git push origin HEAD:review` and flags no Architecture Review exceptions.\\n- [x] `/specify`, `/plan`, and `/tasks` link requirements to constitution principles, Aspire touchpoints, and evidence artifacts (tests + Figma).\\n\\n## Project Structure\\n\\n### Documentation (this feature)\\n\\n```\\nspecs/002-feature-title-login/\\n├── plan.md\\n├── research.md\\n├── data-model.md\\n├── quickstart.md\\n├── contracts/\\n│   └── openapi.yaml\\n└── tasks.md\\n```\\n\\n### Source Code (repository root)\\n\\n```\\nsrc/\\n├── NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.Domain/\\n├── NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.Application/\\n├── NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.Infrastructure/\\n├── NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.Api/\\n├── NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.Web/\\n├── NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.ServiceDefaults/\\n└── NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.UI.Districts/\\n\\ntests/\\n├── unit/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.Application.Tests/\\n├── bdd/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.Bdd/\\n├── ui/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.Playwright/\\n└── aspire/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms.AspireTests/\\n\\nspecs/\\n└── 002-feature-title-login/\\n```\\n\\n**Structure Decision**: Maintain Clean Architecture layering with dedicated projects per layer, plus Blazor Web host and RCL for UI; Aspire AppHost composes Api/Web with ServiceDefaults and shared resources (PostgreSQL, Redis, Identity, Notifications).\\n\\n## Complexity Tracking\\n\\nNo constitution violations or additional complexity exemptions required.\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

Prevent any cross-district data visibility from day one. After sign-in, the Seeded System Admin lands on District Management listing all districts with Create/Edit/Delete. Opening a district shows its District Suffix (email domain matcher) and a District Admins panel. The System Admin can add/edit/remove a district admin email, see Verified/Unverified, and Resend Invite. A District Admin, upon sign-in, never sees platform admin pages and lands on a District Home scoped to their district only. Owns District and DistrictAdmin aggregates, including invite + verification state. Enforces tenant isolation on every query and command. District Suffix is one per district, case-insensitive, and unique platform-wide. Idempotent district/admin create/update within a 10-minute window; invite resend is safe to repeat (latest wins). Emits high-level events (DistrictCreated/Updated/Deleted, DistrictAdminInvited/Verified). Must authenticate users and establish role: System Admin vs District Admin. Must CRUD districts; display and persist unique, case-insensitive suffix. Must CRUD district admin assignments; send invites; track verified/unverified; allow resend. Must restrict District Admins to their district; only System Admin can view all districts and delete districts. Must audit district changes, role assignments, invites, and verification transitions. No cross-district data visibility. Email provider/branding content out of scope.

Step definition files must exist before implementation tasks start.\\n\\n<!--\\n  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.\\n  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,\\n  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.\\n\\n  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.\\n  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:\\n  - Developed independently\\n  - Tested independently\\n  - Deployed independently\\n  - Demonstrated to users independently\\n-->\\n\\n### User Story 1 - System Admin manages districts (Priority: P1)\\n\\nSystem Admin signs in and lands on District Management to view, create, edit, and delete districts. Each district has a unique, case-insensitive email domain suffix used for admin scoping.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Foundational tenant isolation and administration are prerequisites for all downstream functionality.\\n\\n**Figma Flow**:\\n\\n- District Management listing: https://www.figma.com/design/cXwWUeggyig95XE7pJqls3/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms-UI?node-id=22-2&m=dev (see offline breakdown in [`ui-district-management.md`](./ui-district-management.md))\\n- Districts list pane: https://www.figma.com/design/cXwWUeggyig95XE7pJqls3/NorthStarET.NextGen.Lms-UI?node-id=22-31&m=dev\\n- Create District control/modal: https://www.figma.com/design/cXwWUeggyig95XE7pJqls3/NorthStarET\\n[... omitted 0 of 153 lines ...]\\n\\n- **FR-010**: Prefer asynchronous messaging for notifications and event publication; synchronous calls declare latency budgets and fallbacks.\\n- **FR-011**: Secrets are stored only in platform secret store; encrypt in transit and at rest; no secrets in code or logs.\\n- **FR-012**: Test gates: TDD first, Reqnroll Features and step definitions authored before implementation, Playwright journeys defined per story; coverage ≥ 80%.\\n\\n### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_\\n\\n- **District**: Id, Name, DistrictSuffix (unique, case-insensitive), CreatedAt, UpdatedAt\\n- **DistrictAdmin**: Id, DistrictId, Email, Status (Verified|Unverified), InviteSentAt, VerifiedAt, RevokedAt?\\n- **Invite**: Token (opaque), DistrictId, Email, ExpiresAt, IssuedAt, LastResentAt, ResendCount\\n- **AuditRecord**: Id, ActorId, Action, TargetType, TargetId, Timestamp, Metadata\\n\\n## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_\\n\\n<!--\\n  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.\\n  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.\\n-->\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-001**: Creating a district with a new suffix succeeds and is visible in District Management within 2 seconds p95.\\n- **SC-002**: Duplicate suffix attempts are rejected with clear messaging; zero cross-district data leakage in tests.\\n- **SC-003**: Invite → Verified transition completes successfully with a valid token within 5 minutes p95; resends do not create duplicate active invites.\\n- **SC-004**: District Admins are unable to access platform admin pages and other districts (100% denial rate in tests); all denials are audited.\\n- **SC-005**: Automated test suite (unit, integration, BDD, Playwright) maintains ≥ 80% coverage with Red → Green evidence.\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

Content is centered horizontally.\\n- **Top navigation bar** (56px tall)\\n  - Left: product icon (32x32 rounded square) + \\\"District LMS\\\" text.\\n  - Center navigation tabs: “Districts” (active) displayed as filled blue pill (79x32) and \\\"Dashboard\\\" as plain text link.\\n  - Right: user role label “System Administrator”, icon, and “Sign Out” link with icons.\\n- **Page heading**\\n  - Title: “District Management” (Inter Bold 30px, color `#1C2E55`).\\n  - Subtitle: “Manage educational districts and their administrators” (Inter Medium 15.6px, `#8494A5`).\\n  - Horizontal divider line directly beneath the subtitle extends full width (`#D4E0EB`).\\n- **Primary action**\\n  - “Create District” button sits upper-right aligned with heading (160x44 overall).\\n  - Styling: solid `#0054A2` background, 5px radius, white text 13.4px bold, leading plus icon (12x12) tinted white.\\n\\n## District Cards Grid\\n\\n- Three equal-width cards per row (approx 398px wide, 204px tall) with 20px gutter between cards.\\n- Cards rest on background color `#F3F8FE`, 12px rounded corners, and light border `#D4E0EB`.\\n- Internal padding: 24px top/left, ~20px right.\\n\\n### Card Header\\n\\n- Left icon: square 40x40 with rounded corners (8px) containing building glyph tinted blue.\\n- Primary text: District name (Inter Bold 17.6px, `#3B4D6E` – `#3D4E6F`). Allows two lines max.\\n- Secondary label: “District” tag (Inter Bold 16.9px, `#425273`).\\n- Tertiary text: Suffix (e.g., `oakland.edu`) in Inter Medium 13.5px, color `#7E90A4`.\\n- Action icons on right: pencil (edit) and trash (delete), each 13px square, #3D4E6F tinted icons.\\n\\n### Manage Admins CTA (Card Footer)\\n\\n- Contains pill button 348x36 positioned 20px from bottom of card.\\n- Background white with border `#D4E0EB`, radius 8px.\\n- Centered label “Manage Admins” (Inter SemiBold 13.9px, `#54627E`).\\n- Leading icon: group glyph (16x10) tinted same blue as text.\\n\\n## Interaction Guidance\\n\\n- **Create District**: triggers modal entry for new district (per spec). Use primary blue for hover/active states with 5% darken lighten adjustments.\\n- **Manage Admins** button: uses Outline style; hover should slightly darken border (`#C8D5E3`) and text color, fill lighten to `#FFFFFF`.\\n- **Edit/Delete icons**: change color to primary blue on hover; include tooltips.\\n\\n## Asset Summary\\n\\n- **Icons**\\n  - Building glyph for district type (40x40). Use existing icon set or design a monochrome blue asset with 8px corner radius container.\\n  - Manage Admins icon: users/people icon sized 16x10, stroke style 1.5px.\\n  - Pencil (edit) and trash (delete) icons: 13x13, line icons.\\n  - Plus icon for “Create District”: 12x12, white stroke.\\n- **Images**: If using static assets, export to `wwwroot/images/districts/` (naming suggestions `building-default.svg`, `icon-edit.svg`, etc.).\\n\\n## Layout Measurements (px)\\n\\n| Element                | Width | Height | Top Margin                        | Notes                                |\\n| ---------------------- | ----- | ------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |\\n| Nav bar                | 1269  | 58     | 0                                 | white background, 1px bottom divider |\\n| Heading block          | auto  | 120    | 24                                | title + subtitle                     |\\n| Create District button | 160   | 44     | align top 88px from canvas origin | uses 5px radius                      |\\n| Card container         | 398   | 204    | 8                                 | radius 12px, border `#D4E0EB`        |\\n| Manage Admins button   | 348   | 36     | 146 (from card top)               | radius 8px                           |\\n| Icon (card)            | 34–40 | 40     | 51                                | 8px radius                           |\\n\\n## Accessibility Notes\\n\\n- Maintain contrast: primary blue on white is WCAG AA (contrast ~4.7:1).
